# Portfolio website

This is a portfolio website that I created using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. 
It is a simple website that attempts showcases my projects and skills. 

The website is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed [here](https://jacobbekelejansson.com/).
It is a work in progress and I will continue to update it as I learn new things and work on new projects.

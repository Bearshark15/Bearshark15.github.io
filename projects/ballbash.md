# Background

BallBash is a local party racing game for up to 4 people. I worked on this game outside of my studies at Uppsala, however the project was started by one of my classmates as part of a production course that I wasnâ€™t taking at the time. At the start of the game the player chooses a character to play all of which have a set of abilities available to them represented by a deck of cards. The players then race against each other while avoiding obstacles and using their abilities to try and get ahead. The game also features runtime generated levels and environments. On this project most of my work has been on the different abilities in the game as well as the level generation system. 

## Ability System

This is an ongoing project, and it has gone through a few iterations and redesigns, a major one being the ability system. In the beginning of the project the idea was that the player would be able to create a set of abilities, represented by a deck of cards, in the in-game menu and select which one they wanted to use along with a character skin before the game started. This has later been changed to characters with their own predefined set abilities similar to how a hero shooter like Overwatch handles their characters.

Throughout this project I have made extensive use of Unity's ScriptableObject's and in this system I made three core classes deriving from ScriptaleObject: the `Character` class, the `Ability` class, and the `AbilityDeck` class. I choose this approach to make it easier for the designers to create and manage all the different character definitions and ability combinations in the editor. 

> Note: the following code examples are simplified and does not contain all the methods and fields that are in the games actual code base. They are there to help explain and give an overview of the Ability System

### The Character class

```csharp
public class Character : ScriptableObject
{
    [SerializeField] private string m_name;
    [SerializeField, TextArea] private string m_description;
    [SerializeField] private GameObject m_icon;
    [Space]
    [SerializeField] private Material[] m_outsideSkin;
    [SerializeField] private Mesh m_outsideModel;
    [SerializeField] private Material m_insideSkin;
    [SerializeField] private Mesh m_insideModel;
    [Space]
    [SerializeField] private AbilityDeck m_deck;
}
```

The Character and AbilityDeck classes are simple data containers with some utility methods for retrieving data from them. The Character class has fields that define what a character is. In this game it's the characters name and description, it's appearance based on meshes and materials, and the abilities it can use. 

### The AbilityDeck class

```cs
public class AbilityDeck : ScriptableObject, IEnumerable<Ability>
{
    [SerializeField] private bool m_shuffleAtStart;
    [SerializeField] private List<Ability> m_abilities;
}
```

The AbilityDeck class is even simpler as it's just a wrapper around a List to which the designers can add different abilities to create different decks. It also has a an option for shuffling the deck when the game starts. Once a deck as been created it can be added to one of the Character scriptable object in the editor. 

### The Ability class

```csharp
public abstract class Ability : ScriptableObject, ICloneable
{
    public enum AbilityState
    {
        Ready, Active, Swap 
    }

    [SerializeField] protected AbilityProperties m_properties;
    [SerializeField] protected GameObject m_effectPrefab;
    [Space]
    [SerializeField] protected GameObject m_3dPrefab;

    public AbilityProperties Properties => m_properties;

    public bool IsTriggered { get; private set; }

    public AbilityState State { get; private set; }

    protected virtual void OnBegin() {}

    protected virtual void OnActive() {}

    protected virtual void OnEnd() {}

    public abstract object Clone();
}
```

The Ability class is more complicated than the other two. It's is setup like a state machine with three different states: **Ready** (the ability is ready to be used), **Active** (is currently in use), and **Swap** (should be swapped out). The Ability class it self is an abstract class that has several concrete implementations, one for each ability in the game. The behaviour that controls what an ability does is written in the concrete implementations while the logic for the state machine is in the base Ability class. 

The updating of the abilities is done by a MonoBehaviour sitting on the player. It's called the PlayerAbilityManager and it's responsible for storing all the abilities available to the player, triggering abilities when the player presses the designated buttons, and updating the abilities. 

```csharp
public class PlayerAbilityManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Queue<Ability> m_cardQueue;
    private readonly List<Ability> m_active = new();
    private readonly Ability[] m_abilities = { null, null, null };
}
```

The abilities are managed using three collections: a Queue, a List, and an Array with three elements. In the game the players abilities are represented by a deck of cards where the Queue is the players deck and the Array is the players hand that can hold three cards max. When the game starts the Queue is populated with the abilities from an instance of the AbilityDeck class. The first three abilities are immediately popped and put in the abilities array. When the player uses an ability from their hand it's state is changed to Active and taken out of the Array and placed in the List which holds all currently active abilities. A new ability is then popped from the Queue and put in the Array at the index that just became empty/null. When an ability expires it's removed from the List, re-initialized and placed at the end of the Queue.

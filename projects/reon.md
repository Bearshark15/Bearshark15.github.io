# Background

I joined this project in my final semester at Uppsala University and worked on it with three of my classmates as part of our thesis research. This was a game that they had worked on during the semester prior so most of the core mechanics were already largely implemented. The game was made in Unreal Engine 5.

The game is a fast-paced first-person platforming game with a heavy focus on narrative and environmental storytelling. The game is set on an alien planet in a galaxy far far away if you will. The player is the sole survivor of a brutal civil war that ruined their entire planet. Their goal is now to escape this world using an interstellar portal built by the now-deceased government. However, to activate the portal they will need to acquire a power source guarded by an artificial creature built by the government known simply as the Guardian. All in all, they will need to take the power source, outrun the Guardian, and escape through the portal.
